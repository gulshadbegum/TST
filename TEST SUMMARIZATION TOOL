    Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. 
    Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve natural language understanding, natural language generation, and connecting language and machine perception.
    The history of NLP generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.
    In the early days, NLP systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. More recent systems based on machine learning have many advantages over hand-produced rules, such as the ability to learn from data and generalize to new examples.
    Today, NLP is an essential technology behind many widely used applications like search engines, digital assistants, translation services, and chatbots.
